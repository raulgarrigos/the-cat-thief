# Description

The Cat Thief is a game based on classic gameplays you will already know. You are Mochi Ant√∫nez, the famous thief, trying to steal food from Lady Momo, Marquise of Salmonete.

Food and obstacles will fall down, so you can just wait for them, avoiding the obstacles and catching the food to gain points... Or you can move frenetically while you shoot, avoid and catch. Your choice!

I hope you enjoy the game and...

All hail the Cat Thief!!!
